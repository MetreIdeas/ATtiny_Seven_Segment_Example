This program is a driver example for a two-digit seven segment LED display module.
The two digits of the display module share a common set of data lines.
Therefore, to display a two-digit number the individual digits must be displayed
one at time and cycled back and forth continuously.

This code was originally developed for use with the Lite-On LTD2601 display
module (common anode).

Developed for use with Atmel ATtiny261A / ATtiny461A / ATtiny861A
